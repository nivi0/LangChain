# LangChain: Restaurant Idea Generator

## Overview

LangChain is a powerful framework that goes beyond being a Knowledge Engine; it's also a reasoning Engine. This repository showcases the implementation of a Streamlit Application called the "Restaurant Idea Generator" using OpenAI's LLM (Large Language Model) and the LangChain framework.

## Modules

LangChain consists of six modules:
 
1. **Model I/O:** An interface with language models.
2. **Data Connection:** An interface with application-specific data.
3. **Chains:** Construct sequences of calls.
4. **Agents:** Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directives.
5. **Memory:** Persists application state between runs of a chain.
6. **Callbacks:** Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain.

## Application: Restaurant Idea Generator

The Restaurant Idea Generator is a fun and innovative application created using the LangChain framework and OpenAI LLM. Here's what it can do:

- **Functionality:** Pick a country, and the app will generate a fancy restaurant name along with a menu of options.

## Learnings and Implementation

In the process of building this application, the following aspects of LangChain were explored and implemented:

- **LangChain Framework:** Understanding and utilizing the LangChain framework.
- **Agents (Plugins):** Integration of various plugins, including Wikipedia, llm-math, and serpapi.
- **LLM Memory (ConversationBufferWindowMemory):** Leveraging the memory module to persist application state.
- **Callbacks (verbose=True):** Logging and streaming intermediate steps of the chain.

## Reflection

The journey of building the Restaurant Idea Generator was a testament to the power and ease of learning that LangChain provides. The framework, coupled with the capabilities of LLM, allowed for the creation of a sophisticated application with relative ease.
